I have learned a lot from this course. Like how to use Git/Github, how to create a web page through HTML and CSS, and some basic theory and techniques on web programming. 

For the confusing parts, emmm, I am still unfamiliar with a lot of functions of HTML key words so when I want to do something a little different and difficult, I need to go to search "how to xxx with HTML" on Internet. It's time-absorbing, but I think whit more and more practice on HTML, I can solve it. 

Thanks.
